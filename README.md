# Rolls-Royce-Peak-Plower
Deep Q-learning (DQN) and Dyna agent implementation to train the Gymnasium 'MountainCar-v0' with continuous 2D phase-space.

Practical comparison of a model-free and a model-based approach to RL with the Mountaincar environment.

Implementations of:
- basic DQN Agent
- DQN agent with heuristic reward based on environment knowledge
- DQN agent with Random Network Distillation (RND)
